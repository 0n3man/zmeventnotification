What
----
The Event Notification Server sits along with ZoneMinder and offers real time notifications, support for push notifications as well as Machine Learning powered recognition.
As of today, it supports detection of 80 types of objects (persons, cars, etc.) and face recognition. I will add more algorithms over time.
